The LTPBR-Planner supports the documentation and visulization of [Low - Tech Process - Based Restoration](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu) planning and design information.
 - This content is primarily intended for use by [Anabranch Solutions](https://www.anabranchsolutions.com) restoration ecologistis and geomorphologist.
 - The planner is intended to provide a consistent set of standards for documenting the core spatial data components of an LTPBR design plan.
 - The planner template resources consists of a [QGIS project](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/project_files.html) file and [geopackage database](https://www.geopackage.org).
 - Use of the template also allows storage and disemination of LTPBR designs within the [Riverscapes Warehouse](https://data.riverscapes.xyz/#/), and interactivity within ArcMap using the [RAVE Toolbar](http://rave.riverscapes.xyz/base-maps.html)
