<h1>LTPBR PLANNER</h1>
the LTPBR-Planner supports the documentation and presentation of Low - Tech Process - Based Restoration planning and
design information. This project is primarily intended for use by Anabranch Solutions restoration ecologistis and
geomorphologist. The planner template and documentation provides a consistent set of standard for documenting the core
spatial data compoents of an LTPBR planning and design.
